Changes in 1.6.5:
  * Rename CHANGES to CHANGELOG to work with hackage.

Changes in 1.6.4:
  * Drop dependency on happy >= 1.19

Changes in 1.6.3:
  * Add Safe Haskell annotations
  * Add CHANGES file
  * Add generated parser to package again.  We do this, because otherwise
    the package fails to build on systems that do not have `happy`.
    This is a bit questionable, but hopefully it won't be too much of
    a problem.
